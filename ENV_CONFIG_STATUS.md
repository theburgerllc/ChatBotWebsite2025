2. **TAVUS_REPLICA_ID_GENERAL**: `r70c81a0519b` âœ“
   - These were missing and causing the "Start Live Demo" button to fail

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### 1. Push Changes to Production
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 2. Verify Vercel Environment Variables
Since you mentioned you've already added these to Vercel, the deployment should work immediately after pushing.

### 3. Test Production Features
After deployment, verify:
- [ ] "Start Live Demo" button works
- [ ] All 4 industry verticals load properly
- [ ] Error messages display correctly if issues occur
- [ ] Webhook notifications are sent to tim602575@gmail.com

## ðŸ”’ Security Note

**IMPORTANT**: Your `.env` file contains sensitive API keys and should NEVER be committed to Git. Make sure it's in your `.gitignore` file.

To verify it's ignored:
```bash
git status --ignored | grep .env
```

## âœ… Summary

All three critical issues have been resolved:
1. **Missing Tavus variables** - Now configured with actual IDs
2. **Error handling** - Enhanced with user-friendly messages
3. **Email variable mismatch** - Fixed to use SENDGRID_TO_EMAIL

Your application is now ready for production deployment with all necessary environment variables properly configured.
