# Tavus Configuration Fixes - Summary

## Date: 2025-09-09

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Missing Tavus Environment Variables
**Problem:** The "Start Live Demo" button failed because `TAVUS_PERSONA_ID_GENERAL` and `TAVUS_REPLICA_ID_GENERAL` environment variables were missing.

**Solution:** 
- Updated `.env.example` to include all required Tavus configuration variables
- Added clear documentation for all 4 verticals (Healthcare, Legal, E-commerce, General)
- Added instructions on how to obtain these IDs from the Tavus platform
- Created test `.env` file with placeholder values for local testing

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Error Handling in VideoChatWidget
**Problem:** The VideoChatWidget component didn't properly handle or display API errors, leaving users confused when video chat failed to start.

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive error parsing to extract detailed error messages from API responses
- Implemented user-friendly error messages for common scenarios:
  - Rate limiting (429 errors)
  - Missing configuration (400 errors)
  - Server errors (500 errors)
  - Network connection issues
- Added retry counter to show users how many times they've attempted
- Enhanced error UI with dismiss button and better visual design
- Added proper error logging for development environments

### 3. ✅ Fixed Email Notification Variable Mismatch
**Problem:** Webhook notifications failed because `app/api/tavus/webhook/route.ts` expected `LEADS_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` but `.env.example` defined `SENDGRID_TO_EMAIL`.

**Solution:**
- Updated webhook route to use `SENDGRID_TO_EMAIL` to match the existing convention
- Added warning logs when email configuration is missing
- Improved error handling in the notification function

## Files Modified

1. **`.env.example`**
   - Added comprehensive Tavus configuration section with instructions
   - Documented all 8 required Tavus environment variables (4 verticals × 2 IDs each)

2. **`components/VideoChatWidget.tsx`**
   - Enhanced error handling with specific error type detection
   - Added retry counter state
   - Improved error UI with better user feedback
   - Added network error detection

3. **`app/api/tavus/webhook/route.ts`**
   - Changed from `LEADS_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` to `SENDGRID_TO_EMAIL`
   - Added configuration validation with warning logs

4. **`.env`** (Created for testing)
   - Added test configuration file with placeholder values
   - Includes all required environment variables for local testing

## Testing Verification

✅ **TypeScript Compilation:** No errors
✅ **Next.js Build:** Successful with all pages generated
✅ **Environment Variables:** All required variables documented

## Next Steps for Production Deployment

### 1. Configure Vercel Environment Variables
Add the following variables in Vercel Dashboard:
- `TAVUS_PERSONA_ID_GENERAL` - Required for main demo button
- `TAVUS_REPLICA_ID_GENERAL` - Required for main demo button
- Verify all other Tavus variables are set with actual IDs from Tavus platform

### 2. Obtain Actual Tavus IDs
1. Log into Tavus platform at https://platform.tavus.io
2. Navigate to Personas section
3. Create or select personas for each vertical (Healthcare, Legal, E-commerce, General)
4. Copy the Persona IDs
5. Navigate to Replicas section
6. Create or select replicas for each vertical
7. Copy the Replica IDs

### 3. Update Production Environment
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard or CLI
vercel env add TAVUS_PERSONA_ID_GENERAL production
vercel env add TAVUS_REPLICA_ID_GENERAL production
# ... add all other missing variables
```

### 4. Redeploy Application
```bash
vercel --prod
```
