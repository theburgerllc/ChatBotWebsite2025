# Feature Spec

## Problem & Goals

### Problem Statement
Businesses across multiple industries need scalable, cost-effective customer engagement solutions that can provide personalized interactions 24/7. Traditional human-staffed support doesn't scale well and is expensive, while basic chatbots lack the personal touch and engagement of video communication.

### Goals
- Provide real-time AI-powered video conversations through Tavus CVI integration
- Enable seamless monetization via Stripe subscription management
- Automate lead capture and notification through SendGrid integration
- Support multiple industry verticals with specialized AI personas (Healthcare, Legal, E-commerce, General)
- Deliver production-ready solution deployable on Vercel edge infrastructure

## Primary User Story
As a business owner or sales team lead
I want to deploy AI-powered video agents on my website
So that I can provide personalized, engaging customer interactions 24/7 without scaling human staff
